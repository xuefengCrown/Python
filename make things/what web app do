# 对数据做些什么
得看 弗里德曼的《统计学》
缺的是想法，是对世界的深刻洞识
Although the raison d’être of many modern web applications is to take existing data and
format it in a more appealing（吸引人的） way, I would argue that this isn’t very interesting thing to do
in most instances. If you’re using an API as your only data source, the best you can do is
merely copy someone else’s database that already exists, and which is, essentially, already
published. What can be far more interesting is to take two or more data sources and
combine them in a novel way, or use an API as a tool to look at scraped data from a new
perspective.

Let’s look at one example of how data from APIs can be used in conjunction with web
scraping: to see which parts of the world contribute the most to Wikipedia.
