Installation
Do I need to install pip?
pip is already installed if you are using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from python.org 
or if you are working in a Virtual Environment created by virtualenv or pyvenv. Just make sure to upgrade pip.

## 我的python版本是 2.7
pip已经安装
path: C:\Python27\Scripts
将其加入环境变量即可

## 使用pip
pip install numpy
