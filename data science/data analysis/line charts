使用表来组织数据，使得使用row & column来锁定单个数据是容易的。
但是，不利于发现数据之间的模式。
So far, we've mostly been manipulating and working with data that are represented as tables. 
Microsoft Excel, the pandas library in Python, and the CSV file format for datasets were all 
developed around this representation. Because a table neatly organizes values into rows and columns, 
we can easily look up specific values at the intersection of a row value and a column value. 
Unfortunately, it's very difficult to explore a dataset to uncover patterns when it's represented 
as a table, especially when that dataset contains many values. 
We need a different representation of data that can help us identify patterns more easily.

In this mission, we'll learn the basics of data visualization, a discipline that focuses on 
the visual representation of data.
As humans, our brains have evolved to develop powerful visual processing capabilities. 
We can quickly find patterns in the visual information we encounter, which was incredibly 
important from a survivability standpoint. Unfortunately, when data is represented as 
tables of values, we can't really take advantage of our visual pattern matching capabilities. 
This is because our ability to quickly process symbolic values (like numbers and words) is very poor. 
Data visualization focuses on transforming data from table representations visual ones.
