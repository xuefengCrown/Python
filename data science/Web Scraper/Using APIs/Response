As you saw in the FreeGeoIP example at the beginning of the chapter, an important feature
of APIs is that they have well-formatted responses. The most common types of response
formatting are eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

In recent years, JSON has become vastly more popular than XML for a couple of major
reasons. First, JSON files are generally smaller than well-designed XML files. Compare,
for example, the XML data:
<user>
  <firstname>Ryan</firstname>
  <lastname>Mitchell</lastname>
  <username>Kludgist</username>
</user>

which clocks in at 98 characters, and the same data in JSON:
{"user":{"firstname":"Ryan","lastname":"Mitchell","username":"Kludgist"}}
